# Interview Mistakes Of Beginners

To everyone applying for an internship/job, it takes time, and you can face some defeat but don’t give up. Amazon recruited me for an internship after three interviews, attempting more than 30 exams, and applying for more than 70 roles in various companies.

In any recruiting process, you must typically face an interview round. I didn’t have any interview experience till a few days ago. I wanted to share the mistakes that I have made so that others may not make the same mistakes and regret them later. I learned them just by giving interviews for internships. Here are a few tips I wish I had known earlier.

### To be prepared is half the victory

The worst thing about this process is agonizing over getting shortlisted for the interview. The same reason I lost my first interview. Please don’t do it that way. You won’t have enough time. Be patient, and in the meantime, try to prepare for the smaller parts of the interview like intro, resume preparation, etc.

### Information is wealth

Before an interview, talk with people who have interned in that company the previous year or applied for that interview last year. Learn about the interview procedure like the type of question, average duration, the difficulty level of the questions, etc. It will give you a rough idea of the preparation needed for the interview.

### The best thing in the morning is a good night’s sleep

In most colleges, the shortlist for interviews comes at night, and everyone will stay awake till 2–3 AM to see if their name is on that list, but that is a huge mistake. A better approach is to sleep early and wake up early in the morning. So that you will get enough sleep if you get shortlisted for an early morning interview.

### Show gratitude

Try to greet the interviewer when the interview starts, something like “How are you doing?”, “Thank you for taking your time for this interview,” showing gratitude to them. The interviewer might have done so many interviews since that day. They would feel a change of pace from the monotonous responses from other interviewees.

### Never sell yourself short

Some companies may not ask about your projects and ask CP questions(Software role) after listening to your intro. You might have dedicated a lot of time to building your projects which signifies how much knowledge you have. So try to add your project fragments in your introduction, but just briefly. Upon completion of the opening, ask the interviewer if he wants to know about your projects in detail. If he wishes to know more, then explain in detail. Make sure you are thorough with everything present in your resume. In my case, I have used MongoDB for one of my projects. They asked me why I had used a non-relational and not a relational database.

### Worry often gives a small thing a big shadow

Remain calm. Speak/Think out loud. When thinking about how to solve the question, try to say everything you think out loud. The interviewer must understand how and why you reached a conclusion. In most cases, they try to guide you in the right direction.

### Before you assume, try this crazy thing called asking

Do not assume things. Get your ambiguous questions clarified by the interviewer. Try to ask and make sure you understand the question perfectly.

### Something is better than nothing

All interviews have a fixed amount of time, so make sure you ask for a hint if you did not get the solution to a question. Do not waste all the time thinking by yourself and not giving any answer.

### Don’t doubt yourself

While giving a solution, always try to sound confident. Do not lose confidence.

### Show them you are interested in working for that company

When the interviewer asks if you have any questions at the end, try to ask about the exact role, what you would work on, etc. It shows that you are interested in working in that company and want to learn more about it.

If they ask you about what you want to work on, be sure to say the role that you are applying for or say something like, “I am interested in …… but I would love to explore new fields, and I would be happy to work in this role and learn about it”.

### Practice makes anyone excellent

Try to give mock interviews with your friends. The more mock interviews you give, the less tense you will feel, and mostly explore some possible questions the interviewers may ask you in an interview. You will not feel overwhelmed by new questions.

### Conclusion

Interviews can be challenging, but with proper preparation, you can tackle them perfectly.
